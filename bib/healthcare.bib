  abstract = {Abstract The inclusion of caregivers in a holistic care approach represents a basic principle in palliative care. However, many palliative care professionals have a lack of understanding of difficulties or unmet needs among caregivers. To enhance the quality of life of caregivers and the quality of care for patients, healthcare professionals should be better informed about the constructs of caregiver burden. The aim of this study is to synthesize the concept of caregiver burden in palliative care, providing implications for the caregivers and their support systems. This concept analysis study adopts the integrative review approach and the basic text analysis method (ie, word frequency). The PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO databases are explored for eligible studies. From this literature search, 66 articles from 1998 to 2018 are located. After data collection is completed, the two authors independently evaluate the quality of studies published before 1 September 2018. The caregiver burden is then redefined with its attributes, antecedents, consequences, empirical referents, and facilitators. It is recommended that the multidimensional concept of caregiver burden in palliative care be measured by considering caregiver characteristics and the caregiving context.},
