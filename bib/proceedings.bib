  abstract   = {Collaborative document editing tools are widely used in professional and academic workplaces. While these tools provide basic accessibility support, it is challenging for blind users to gain collaboration awareness that sighted people can easily obtain using visual cues (e.g., who is editing where and what). Through a series of co-design sessions with a blind coauthor, we identified the current practices and challenges in collaborative editing, and iteratively designed CollabAlly, a system that makes collaboration awareness in document editing accessible to blind users. CollabAlly extracts collaborator, comment, and text-change information and their context from a document and presents them in a dialog box to provide easy access and navigation. CollabAlly uses earcons to communicate background events unobtrusively, voice fonts to differentiate collaborators, and spatial audio to convey the location of document activity. In a study with 11 blind participants, we demonstrate that CollabAlly provides improved access to collaboration awareness by centralizing scattered information, sonifying visual information, and simplifying complex operations.},

While reviews of STEM education from various funding agencies exist, these reviews encompass STEM education across formal and informal settings, which may not provide specific implications that center around libraries. This paper examines the trend of collaboration among libraries and other collaborating organizations involved in STEM education funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). Through content analysis and geocode analysis of 128 projects that are funded by IMLS in 2012–2022, this study shows the diverse engagement of different types of informal learning institutions in STEM education over time. Findings also demonstrate that while few informal learning institutions represented the leading and collaborating organizations in IMLS STEM education initially, leading and collaborating organizations diversified with a higher level of collaboration.},

Yet, relatively little has been known about how blind programmers help each other to solve problems. We present a data-driven approach to explore collaborative problem-solving of users in the Program-l community of, by, and for blind programmers. We collected 8,344 longitudinal email threads from 778 users from 2004 through 2022 to observe the dynamics of collaborative problem-solving among blind programmers. Our embedding-based topic modeling and assortativity network analysis reveal that the knowledge of blind programmers diverges between when asking and answering questions. Our findings also suggest that users who have a high cluster level in the first year of activity and members are more likely to interact with other members with different roles. Our paper contributes to the field of social computing by introducing the first large-scale study of a unique community of blind programmers.},

Our shared journey is portrayed through examples drawn from our interaction with GitHub issues, pull requests, review processes, and insider’s releases, each contributing to an improved VSCode experience for blind developers. One key milestone of our co-design process is the establishment of an accessible terminal buffer, a significant enhancement for blind developers using VSCode. Other innovative outcomes include Git Diff audio cues, adaptable verbosity settings, intuitive help menus, and a targeted accessibility testing initiative. These tailored improvements not only uplift the accessibility standards of VSCode but also provide a valuable blueprint for open-source developers at large. Through our shared dedication to promoting inclusivity in software development, we aim for the strategies and successes shared in this paper to inspire and guide the open-source community towards crafting more accessible software environments.},

In addition to sonification and textual descriptions that are commonly employed by existing accessible visualizations, our MAIDR (multimodal access and interactive data representation) system incorporates two additional modalities (braille and review) that offer complementary benefits. It also provides blind users with the autonomy and control to interactively access and understand data visualizations. In a user study involving 11 blind participants, we found the MAIDR system facilitated the accurate interpretation of statistical visualizations. Participants exhibited a range of strategies in combining multiple modalities, influenced by their past interactions and experiences with data visualizations. This work accentuates the overlooked potential of combining refreshable tactile representation with other modalities and elevates the discussion on the importance of user autonomy when designing accessible data visualizations.},

However, despite the accessibility barriers, some blind individuals persistently use such systems and even express satisfaction with them. To obtain a deeper understanding of blind users' prolonged experiences in PHTs, we interviewed 11 individuals who continue to use such technologies, discussing and observing their past and current interactions with their systems. We report on usability issues blind users encounter and how they adapt to these situations, and theories for the persistent use of PHTs in the face of poor accessibility. We reflect on strategies to improve the accessibility and usability of PHTs for blind users, as well as ideas to aid the normalization of accessible features within these systems.},
