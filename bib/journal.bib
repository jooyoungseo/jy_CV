  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to explore three computational approaches to ethnographic research within digital learning environments: virtual ethnography; quantitative ethnography; and computational ethnography. Recently, researchers have become more interested in computational ethnographic approaches due to their alignment with the massive datasets currently available in digital archives. Although these approaches have attracted growing attention in recent years, their methodological characteristics (e.g., goals, procedures, and techniques) have yet to be fully explored. In this scoping review, we explore existing and the three emerging computational methods for ethnographic research, along with their applications within digital learning environments. We first conduct a scoping review by sampling and synthesizing 86 articles using bibliometric and thematic analyses. This review is then used to reveal the similarities and differences among the three computationally-enabled ethnographic approaches and engage in a concomitant discussion of digital learning designs. In addition, this study explores implications of this type of research for learning design. This research contributes to a better understanding of the characteristics and applications of computational approaches across various digital learning environments.},

  abstract     = {Purpose In response to the underexplored need for holistically inclusive makerspaces for learning, we put propose the “SCAFFOLD” framework, which considers equity, inclusion and accessibility in the design of spaces and activities for socioculturally diverse learners. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a universal design (UD) framework that is intersectionally inclusive for learners with diverse needs in makerspaces and maker activities. This paper provides conjecture mapping to put forth theoretical and empirical arguments for the design of holistically inclusive makerspaces that consider gender equity and cultural inclusivity, as well as accessibility for diverse learners with divergent and unique abilities and dis/abilities. Findings Combining related literature and three existing UD frameworks (i.e. UD, web accessibility and UD for learning) and prior research on equity and inclusivity in making, this paper proposes the integration of eight principles, which leverage individuals’ diverse abilities to become agentic makers: simplicity, collaboration, accessibility, flexibility, fail-safe, object-oriented, linkability and diversity. Research limitations/implications Researchers who have implemented conjecture maps (Lee et al., 2018) have found them to be useful for developing theory and learning designs grounded in research and practice. However, it should be noted that design research is iterative and contextual, and conjecture maps are effective in providing visibility and rigor, but are meant to be flexible and responsive to changes in context (Lee et al., 2018; Sandoval, 2014). Originality/value This paper provides practical guidelines and principles for researchers, educators, instructional designers and product developers to assess and redesign makerspaces and activities that are intersectionally and universally inclusive, equitable and accessible.},

Such vision-dependent output may cause critical barriers against those who are blind and visually impaired and people with learning disabilities. We argue that instructors need to teach multiple data representation methods so that all students can produce data products that are more accessible. In this paper, we argue that accessibility should be taught as early as the introductory course as part of the data science curriculum so that regardless of whether learners major in data science or not, they can have foundational exposure to accessibility. As data science educators who teach accessibility as part of our lower-division courses in two different institutions, we share specific examples that can be utilized by other data science instructors.},

We collected and analyzed a total of 27 empirical journal articles that study and discuss learning analytics design and implementation in seamless learning environments. In a recent decade, researchers have explored various seamless learning environments supporting students’ inquiry-based and experiential learning. Seamless learning aims to engage students to develop, elaborate, and apply knowledge to various inquiry-based learning contexts. With the significance of formative assessment in digital learning environments, integrating learning analytics into seamless learning environments increasingly evolved to trace and assess student learning. Despite various uses of learning analytics during seamless learning, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews that illustrate how learning analytics has been integrated into seamless learning. This literature synthesis decomposes the collected journal articles to understand learning analytics design and integrations inherent to seamless learning environments. Also, using qualitative thematic analysis, this systematic literature review demonstrates various design practices and future research directions of learning analytics in seamless learning environments.},

  abstract     = {Background: Personal health technologies, including wearable tracking devices and mobile apps, have great potential to equip the general population with the ability to monitor and manage their health. However, being designed for sighted people, much of their functionality is largely inaccessible to the blind and low-vision (BLV) population, threatening the equitable access to personal health data (PHD) and health care services. Objective: This study aims to understand why and how BLV people collect and use their PHD and the obstacles they face in doing so. Such knowledge can inform accessibility researchers and technology companies of the unique self-tracking needs and accessibility challenges that BLV people experience. Methods: We conducted a web-based and phone survey with 156 BLV people. We reported on quantitative and qualitative findings regarding their PHD tracking practices, needs, accessibility barriers, and work-arounds. Results: BLV respondents had strong desires and needs to track PHD, and many of them were already tracking their data despite many hurdles. Popular tracking items (ie, exercise, weight, sleep, and food) and the reasons for tracking were similar to those of sighted people. BLV people, however, face many accessibility challenges throughout all phases of self-tracking, from identifying tracking tools to reviewing data. The main barriers our respondents experienced included suboptimal tracking experiences and insufficient benefits against the extended burden for BLV people. Conclusions: We reported the findings that contribute to an in-depth understanding of BLV people’s motivations for PHD tracking, tracking practices, challenges, and work-arounds. Our findings suggest that various accessibility challenges hinder BLV individuals from effectively gaining the benefits of self-tracking technologies. On the basis of the findings, we discussed design opportunities and research areas to focus on making PHD tracking technologies accessible for all, including BLV people. Trial Registration:},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) offers promising opportunities for supporting autistic learners in developing social and cognitive skills. However, designing VR-based learning environments optimized for these learners requires a nuanced understanding that addresses their unique needs. This review article reconsiders the key theories of multimedia learning, including cognitive load theory and cognitive theory of multimedia learning, with the aim of illuminating how these theories can inform the development of effective VR-based learning environments for autistic learners. We propose four design goals for a VR-based learning environment optimized for autistic learners: (1) minimizing learners’ extraneous load via attention guiding, (2) managing intrinsic cognitive load in problem-solving, (3) fostering germane processing through multiple representations, and (4) assessing cognitive load and implementing adaptive learning support design. In this exploration, we bring to demonstrate prevalent design challenges of existing VR-based learning environments for autistic individuals and offer prospective research trajectories for their enhancement. By incorporating a strengths-based approach, accommodating the diverse sensory needs, and recognizing the cognitive differences among autistic individuals, we aspire to advance a more inclusive VR design practice. This review presents crucial insights and direction for researchers and designers aiming to create effective, accessible, and inclusive VR-based learning environments for autistic learners and beyond.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to provide readers with three critical concepts that can maximize inclusivity of learner experience (LX) and user experience (UX) design: accessibility, usability, and universal design for learning (UDL). Although recent K-12 and postsecondary education have experienced rapid change in its student population with the growing awareness of the equal opportunities for all, general design methods of addressing such diversity across formal and informal learning contexts are still prone to retrofitted changes to predefined instructions in favor of standardization. This is due in part to the limited interpretation of accessibility as the concept for the medical model of disabilities where learners with disabilities are not regarded as users or consumers, but as clients or patients. Moreover, LX and UX have been widely designed with the usability of dominant group in mind while trading off exclusion of those who cannot fit themselves into it. However, accessibility and usability are not mutually exclusive; rather, a truly inclusive learning design (i.e. UDL) comes from the interplay between them. Through the paper, we provide definition and description of each concept and provide practical examples of how UDL principles can be applied to inclusive learning design.},
