# JooYoung Seo's Academic CV

This repo has been created to systematically manage my academic CV. This is reproducible for those who have basic knowledge of R and R Markdown.

Based on [vitae package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae/), I have extended its capabilities to include multiple bibliographic entries using [multiple-bibliographies lua filter](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/blob/master/multiple-bibliographies/multiple-bibliographies.lua) so that I can print my scientific records in [APA_CV style](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/apa-cv.csl).

Following my template, you would be able to print as many bib-entries as you want using your desired csl file and your `*.bib` files.

Anyone who would like to get a hint on how I have managed [this CV]() can fork this repo to make their own.
